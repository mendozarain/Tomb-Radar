Grave Mapping and Navigation using an  Android-based Mobile Application
The Grave Mapping and Navigation app is an Android-based mobile application that allows users to easily find and navigate to graves in cemeteries. The app features a user-friendly interface and a variety of features, such as:

Grave search: Users can search for graves by name, date of death, or cemetery.
Grave navigation: The app provides turn-by-turn directions to graves, using the user's current location.
Cemetery map: The app includes a detailed map of each cemetery, with grave locations marked.
Grave information: The app displays information about each grave, such as the name of the deceased, date of death, and epitaph.
How it works:
The Grave Mapping and Navigation app uses GPS technology to track the user's location and provide directions to graves. The app also uses a database of grave locations to generate accurate and up-to-date directions.
